# Telepresence

## Introduction
Modern microservices-based applications that are deployed into Kubernetes often consist of tens or hundreds of services. The resource constraints and a number of these services mean that it is often difficult or impossible to run all of this on a local development machine, which makes fast development and debugging very challenging.

Telepresence enables you to connect your local development machine seamlessly to the K8s cluster via a two-way proxying mechanism. This enables you to code locally and run the majority of your services within a K8s cluster.

Installation and workflows with example
The following document provides the steps users can use to install the tool and workflows for local development using telepresence.
